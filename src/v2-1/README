This rootkit works on kernel 3.2!

If you want to install this rootkit, you should run "source my_rootkit.sh" with root permission.

This rootkit runs one backdoor with Port 12345 and password 12345, so you can get a root shell 
in another machine with IP and Port 12345, then you should enter the password 12345, you will find 
you get the root shell.

If you want to uninstall the rootkit, you can find how the shell my_rootkit_uninstall.sh works, you 
should remove some files, then restart the machine!
